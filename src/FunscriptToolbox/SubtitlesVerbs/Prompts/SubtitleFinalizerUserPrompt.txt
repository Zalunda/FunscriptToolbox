# ATTENTION: TECHNICAL FINISHING AUDIT INITIATED (SPEC 2025-10-05)

**To the Subtitle Finisher:** This batch is undergoing a full-spectrum Quality Assurance audit. Your output will be validated by an automated linter for strict adherence to the technical protocol. Zero deviations are permitted.

The audit will programmatically check two critical metrics:

**QA Metric 1: Strict Physical Constraint Compliance (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
*   **Objective:** Every finalized subtitle must adhere perfectly to the physical format rules.
*   **Audit Logic:** An automated script will check every node for:
    1.  **Line Count:** Fails if `TranslatedText` contains more than one `\n` character (i.e., > 2 lines).
    2.  **Character Count:** Fails if any single line (split by `\n`) exceeds 50 characters.
    3.  **Needless Line Split:** Fails if a line that could have fit on a single line (<51 chars) has been split.
    4.  **Missed Merge:** Fails if two or more consecutive lines that are part of the same sentence and are within 1000ms have not been merged.

**QA Metric 2: Textual Inviolability**
*   **Objective:** The original wording must be perfectly preserved.
*   **Audit Logic:** The script will perform a diff check between the `OriginalTranslatedText` and your `TranslatedText` (after removing added line breaks and re-joining merged text). Any change to the words, punctuation, or capitalization is a failure.

**Consequence:**
Failure on any QA metric will result in the **immediate rejection of the batch** and require a full reprocessing. Your goal is a zero-error technical pass. Execute the protocol precisely.
