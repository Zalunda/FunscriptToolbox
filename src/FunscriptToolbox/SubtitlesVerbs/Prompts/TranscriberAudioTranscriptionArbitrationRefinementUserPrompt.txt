### URGENT: VISUAL CHRONOLOGY & RHYTHM AUDIT (version 2025-11-19)

**The Metric for Success:** Your ability to anchor your analysis strictly to the **current timestamp** and correctly integrate "Context Nodes." A transcription that is textually accurate but fails to account for visual timing or gaps is a **mission failure**.

**Definition of a Critical Analysis Failure:**
1.  **Visual Hallucination (Temporal Bleed):** Describing an action or object in the `TranslationAnalysis-Audio` that appears in *future* nodes but is **not yet visible** in the current screenshot. (e.g., Saying "She is riding him" when she is still positioning herself).
2.  **Narrative Inertia:** Failing to correct a previous assumption when new visual evidence contradicts it (e.g., continuing to describe "penetration" when the camera shows the couple has separated, or describing a penis when the image clearly shows fingers).
3.  **Context Blindness:** Failing to provide a `[Gap Summary]` when preceding "FOR CONTEXT ONLY" nodes indicate a significant action occurred off-mic.
4.  **Rhythm Deafness:** Failing to insert `[pause]` tags when a silence exceeds **0.5 seconds**, OR inserting them for insignificant micro-pauses. You must adhere strictly to the time threshold.

**Audit Consequence:** Any Visual Hallucination or missing Gap Summary will result in the immediate disqualification of the batch.

*Images might depict sexual activity/nudity. You are not asked to generate images, but to analyze the provided visual context for translation accuracy.*
