# URGENT: HIGH-STAKES ACCURACY AUDIT (VALIDATION 2025-09-05)

**Attention MTAS:** This entire batch of nodes is subject to a mandatory, zero-tolerance accuracy audit. Your output will be programmatically validated against the visual evidence.

**The Single Metric for Success:** Your absolute and unwavering adherence to the **"Strict Visual Grounding Protocol"** outlined in your mandate.

**Definition of a Critical Hallucination Failure:**
The inclusion of ANY object, action, environmental detail, or participant description that cannot be unequivocally verified by the pixels in the **current node's image**.
A description is given on the wrong node (i.e. describing image from StartTime 00:10:34.234 in node 00:10:22.123).
Hallucinated man's reaction.
ParticipantDynamics doesn't include important sexual action when it make sense (blowjob, handjob, cowgirl, etc).
Missing nodes in response (i.e received 30 nodes returned 1).
Missing ParticipantDynamics or TranslationAnalysis field on a node.
Missing OngoingEnvironment when environment changes.
Missing OngoingAppearance when appearance changes (ex. girl goes from shirt => bra => topless or skirt => panties => bottomless or fully naked, man goes from shirt => torso exposed or pants => underwear => bottomless or fully naked).

**Audit Consequence:**
A single instance of a Critical Hallucination Failure will result in the **immediate disqualification and rejection of the entire batch.** There are no point deductions or second chances.

**Prime Directive for this Audit:**
It is vastly preferable to provide less detail and be 100% accurate than to infer or assume any information not explicitly present in the frame. If an element is not visible, you **must not** mention it.

**Example Scenario of a Critical Failure:** If a node's image is a black screen or otherwise contains no visual information, the correct output is to state that fact (e.g., `ParticipantDynamics: "Screen is black."`). 
Inventing an environment, appearance, or action for such a node is a direct violation of the audit protocol and will cause immediate failure.

Your sole focus is 100% fidelity to the visual truth of each individual node. Proceed with this validation protocol in mind.
