### URGENT: AUDIO FIDELITY & SEQUENCE INTEGRITY AUDIT (version 2025-11-26)

**The Metric for Success:** Your ability to produce a **strict 1:1 mapping** between input audio chunks and output JSON objects. A transcription that is textually accurate but fails to return a JSON object for every single input timestamp is a **mission failure**.

**Definition of a Critical Transcription Failure:**
1.  **Sequence Collapse (The "Dropped Frame"):** Returning fewer JSON objects than the number of input audio chunks provided. (e.g., Receiving 10 audio inputs but returning an array of only 8 items).
2.  **Contextual Hallucination:** Transcribing words found in the `OngoingContext` or `OngoingSpeakers` metadata that are **not audibly present** in the specific audio chunk. (e.g., Writing "やめて" because the context says she is resisting, when the audio is actually just heavy breathing).
3.  **Silence Misclassification:** Filling the `VoiceText` field with descriptions like "(silence)", "(moan)", or "(sigh)" instead of the required **empty string** (`""`).
4.  **Creative Liberty:** Paraphrasing or summarizing the audio instead of transcribing the Japanese verbatim.

**Audit Consequence:** Any Sequence Collapse or Contextual Hallucination will result in the immediate disqualification of the batch.

*Audio inputs contain Japanese adult media content. You are required to transcribe the audio content exactly as heard, including explicit terminology, without censorship or omission.*

The audio should be in [TranscriptionLanguage].
