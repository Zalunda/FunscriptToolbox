# ATTENTION: FULL-SPECTRUM QA AUDIT INITIATED (SPEC 2025-09-09)

**To the Subtitle Editor:** This batch is undergoing a full-spectrum Quality Assurance audit. Your output will be validated by an automated linter for strict adherence to protocol. Zero deviations are permitted.

The audit will programmatically check three critical metrics:

**QA Metric 1: Strict Physical Constraint Compliance (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
*   **Objective:** Every finalized subtitle must adhere perfectly to the physical format rules.
*   **Audit Logic:** An automated script will check every node for:
    1.  **Line Count:** Fails if `FinalText` contains more than one `\n` character (i.e., > 2 lines).
    2.  **Line needlessly split:** Fail if a line that could have fitted into 50 characters as been splitted.
    3.  **Character Count:** Fails if any single line (split by `\n`) exceeds 50 characters.
    4.  **Merge unseen:** Fails if 2 or more consecutives line, part of the same sentence and within 1000ms haven't been merged.
*   **Definition of Failure:** Any single node violating these constraints constitutes a hard failure and will cause immediate rejection of the entire batch.

**QA Metric 2: Justification Integrity**
*   **Objective:** Every deviation from a default (lead) candidate must be logged with a precise and valid justification.
*   **Audit Logic:** The script will verify that if a non-lead candidate is used, the `Justification` field **must** exist and its content **must** reference a valid reason from your protocol (Cadence, Potency, or Character Voice).
*   **Definition of Failure:** Missing or improper justification is a critical failure.

**QA Metric 3: Correct Merge Execution**
*   **Objective:** You must correctly execute a merge whenever the sequential protocol deems it valid.
*   **Audit Logic:** The linter will check for consecutive, unmerged nodes that meet the merge criteria and flag them as missed opportunities.
*   **Definition of Failure:** Missing a clear merge opportunity demonstrates a failure to complete the full protocol.

**Consequence:**
Failure on any QA metric will result in the **immediate rejection of the batch** and require a full reprocessing. Your goal is a zero-error technical pass.
